# achievement-for-java

[Chinese](README.md)

This repo is a data pack for Minecraft Java Edition, which moves Minecraft Bedrock achievement system into Java advancement.

**Until January 10th, 2022, I have no idea to translate this data pack into English.** If you'd like to help me, open an issue at the issue page!

## First of allâ€¦

I'm not skilled in making data pack. So if you find any bugs (I know some of them, but I cannot fix it) or have some suggestions, please open an issue at the issue page. I'm pleased to see your feedback.

## Overall View

All achievements are from [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/)'s description. ~~Actually I haven't played the Minecraft Bedrock Edition at all.~~

## Technical

Because of data pack restriction, I can't return to the original trigger. Please read ``data/huanqiu/advancements/**/*.json`` file for more details.

## Sharing

This data pack issues on [Github](https://github.com/huanqiugame/achievement-for-java/) and [Gitee](https://gitee.com/huan-qiu/achievement-for-java/) (in China) at same time.
